        <h1>Properties, Events, and Methods</h1>
        <p>
          The goal of this lab is to make you comfortable with the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/video.html#htmlmediaelement" target="_blank">properties, methods</a>, and the 
          <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/video.html#mediaevents" target="_blank">events</a> of the HTML 5 video attribute. Refer to those 
          previous links for the full reference.
        </p>		
		<p>
            Open up the page.html file in the before directory of this lab. Your goal is to apply what you've 
            learned about JavaScript and what you've learned about HTML 5 video and add the following to the page.
            <ul>
                <ol>- A video that will play in your browser. You can search the web for downloadable clips.</ol>
                <ol>- Hook up all the buttons on the page to interact with the video (play, pause, etc). </ol>
                <ol>- Wire up all the events in the events table to display the total number of times
                    the events have fired.
                </ol>
                <ol>
                    - Every 1 second, refresh the property values in the property table. 
                </ol>
            </ul>        			
		</p>		
        <p>
            If you are clever, you can do all of the above with less than 50 lines of JavaScript code. 
            It is not nessecary to use a JavaScript library, but you can use any framework or library 
            that you already know. Refer to the page in the after folder if you want some additional hints.
