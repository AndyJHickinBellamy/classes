Lab 01 : Introduction to Angular
Estimated Time: 50 minutes

This first lab is intended to get you up and running with Angular 2. You'll need to 
implement the following requirements using AngularJS in your development 
environment:

	Write a web page that displays a list of movies to the user. 

	Example:

	Title         Length     
	Star Wars V   120        
	Star Wars III 120        
	Star Wars I   120        


Create the movies directly in the main application component. Don't worry about using classes
as yet, just create the movies using object literals ({title: 'Star Wars', length: 120 });

To get setup, you'll need to use npm to install Angular 2 and Angular dependencies (or
use Yeoman, a seed project, or the demo files for this class). 

The current minimum npm packages include:
	angular2
        reflect-metadata
        rxjs
        systemjs
        typescript
	zone.js
