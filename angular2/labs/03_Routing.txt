Lab 03 : Routing
Estimated Time: 40 minutes

The project should support two pages and be able to route between the pages with navigation links.

The two pages are the Movie List page, and the About page. 

To make this work you'll need to introduce the routing services and directives of Angular 2. The top level
App component will show the shell page and plug in child components with the <router-outlet> directive and 
link between the two pages using [routerLink] directives inside of <a> tags.
