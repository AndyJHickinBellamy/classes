Lab 04 : HTTP
Estimated Time: 30 minutes

The project should now fetch movie data from an HTTP API and allow the user to click 
on a movie for more details (the details should route to a new component). 

The API is part of the starter project for the class. You can send a GET request to 
/api/movies to retrieve all movies, and /api/movies/:id to retrieve a single movie. 

If you are not using the starter project, you can also use the API at http://otc-movies.azurewebsites.net/movies
