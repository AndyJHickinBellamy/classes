Lab 06 : Forms
Estimated Time: 40 minutes

The user should be able to click on a "Edit" button from the movie list and work with a form to edit movies. 

The detail page should include a link to cancel and navigate back to the full movie list. Another button 
should allow the users to save the edited movie (an HTTP PUT back to the server). After a save operation, 
the application should automatically 'redirect' back to the movie details for the edited movie. 

As a bonus, also add a link the the movie list for creating a new movie (an HTTP POST). The edit and create
features should be able to share the same component and template.
