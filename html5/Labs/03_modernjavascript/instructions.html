        <h1>JavaScript Koans</h1>
        <p>
           For this lab we'll be using the JavaScript Koans created by <a href="http://hackingon.net/" target="_blank">Liam Mclennan</a>.
		   If you haven't heard about programming koans, see: <a href="http://sett.ociweb.com/sett/settJan2011.html" target="_blank">Learning Programming Languages with Koans</a>
        </p>		
		<p>
			The goal of this lab is to open up the page.html file in the before directory of this lab 
			and make all of the QUnit tests pass. You'll do this not by editing page.html (it is just a test runner), 
			but by editing the .js files in the before\topics folder. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Some of the koans are easy, some of them you might find quite challenging. Feel free to search the 
			internet for reference material and understand the true meaning behind a test that stumps you. If you
			are blocked by a test, try using a debugger, or ask the instructor for help. In the worst case scenario, 
			refer to the after directory for the solution.
