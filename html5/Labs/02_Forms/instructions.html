        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>
            The Draconian Company IT department needs your help. They have a web page where users 
			can report bugs for internal applications, but all the users say the 
			form is difficult to use, and time consuming to fill out from a mobile device. 
        </p>
		<p>
			Open up the current support page in the before directory of this lab. See how many 
			improvements you can make to the page while completing the requirements listed below. 
			Refer to the redesigned page in the after folder if you need some tips.

		<h1>Requirements</h1>
		<ol>
			<li>All fields are required. Currently users submit pages with blank data.</li>
			<li>The page should open with focus in the first name field</li>
			<li>The email address should be validated as an email address, and open the 
				keyboard with an "@" sign on the CTO's iPhone. 
			</li>
			<li>
				The user should not be allowed to use auto completion for thier email address.
				Draconian wants them to type the entire address everytime there is a bug, to 
				make sure they really want the bug fixed.
			</li>
			<li>The phone number entry should be 7, 10, or 11 digits. Hyphens are optional.
				The phone number entry should also use the special phone entry keyboard on mobile.
			</li>
			<li>
				The page URL should be a valid URL. 
			</li>
			<li>
				The "number of times this has happened" field should use a spinner control to 
				allow the user to increment a number. The valid range is 1 to 1000.
			</li>
			<li>
				The frustration level input should be a slider control yielding a value between
				1 and 11 inclusive. To the left of the slider use the text "a little", to the 
				right of the slider use the text "nuclear". 
			</li>
			<li>
				Validate the date of the incident as a full date (day, month, and year). 
			</li>
			<li>
				The operating system entry should auto-complete with a value of 
				Window 7, Windows 8, Mac OS/X, or Linux.
