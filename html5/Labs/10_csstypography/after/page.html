       <pre>
        He ate and drank the precious words,                
       
        His spirit grew robust;                             
       
        He knew no more that he was poor                    

        Nor that his frame was dust                         
       </pre>

       <pre>
        He danced along the dingy days,                     

        And this bequest of wings                           

        Was but a book. What liberty                        

        A loosened spirit brings.            
       </pre>    
    </div>            
</body>
